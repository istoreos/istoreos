Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: support limiting 4K sectors support based on
 flash size

Some devices need 4K sectors to be able to deal with small flash chips.
For instance, w25x05 is 64 KiB in size, and without 4K sectors, the
entire chip is just one erase block.
On bigger flash chip sizes, using 4K sectors can significantly slow down
many operations, including using a writable filesystem. There are several
platforms where it makes sense to use a single kernel on both kinds of
devices.

To support this properly, allow configuring an upper flash chip size
limit for 4K sectors support.
