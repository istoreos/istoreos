config IO_DOMAIN
	bool "Enable io domain support using Driver Model"
	depends on DM && OF_CONTROL
	help
	  Enable support for the io domain driver class. Many SoCs allow
	  power to be applied to or removed from portions of the SoC (io
	  domains). This may be used to save power. This API provides the
	  means to control such power management hardware.

config ROCKCHIP_IO_DOMAIN
	bool "Enable the rockchip io domain driver"
	depends on IO_DOMAIN && ARCH_ROCKCHIP
	help
	  Enable support for manipulating ROCKCHIP io domains via MMIO mapped
	  registers.
